Remove the string from both ends of your bow; and the arrows in your hand, O adorable one, cast them far away. Salutation to the blue-necked one with a thousand eyes, the granter of wishes! And to his hosts, I offer salutations. Unstring your bow, O thousand-eyed one, with a hundred quivers; having shattered the tips of the shafts, be auspicious and cheerful to us. May the bow of the Kapardin (long-haired god) be unstrung, and his quiver shaft-less. May His arrows be powerless, and His quiver resting. O Mīḍhuṣṭama (greatest benefactor), may the missile in your hand, and your bow, keep us safe from harm from all sides, free from disease. Salutation to your weapon that is not bent (unstrung), and ready to shoot, to both your arms, and to your bow. May the missile of your bow turn away from us on all sides; and may the quiver which is yours, keep it far away from us. Salutations to Śambhu. Salutations to you, O Lord, to the Lord of the Universe, to the Great God (Mahādeva), to the three-eyed one (Tryambaka), to the destroyer of the three cities (Tripurāntaka), to the Lord of the three sacrificial fires, to the Rudra who is the fire of Time, to the blue-necked one (Nīlakaṇṭha), to the conqueror of Death (Mṛtyuñjaya), to the Lord of All (Sarveśvara), to the eternally auspicious one (Sadāśiva), to the glorious Great God, salutation."
